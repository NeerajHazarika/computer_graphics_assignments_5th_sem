# Approach for features

- animal function 
- it has function parameter as vector array
- eg: if in body part 3 (beak), we set value at index 2 of vector as 2 then Feature 2 will be selected (Toothy, Toothless)
- we have to create function to draw each type of shape (triangle, circle, ellipse)
- input for each of these functions should only have coordinates
